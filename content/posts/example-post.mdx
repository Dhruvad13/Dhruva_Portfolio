# Building Modern Web Applications with Next.js 14

Next.js 14 introduces powerful new features that make building modern web applications easier and more efficient than ever before. In this post, we'll explore the key improvements and how to leverage them in your projects.

## Key Features

### App Router
The new App Router provides a more intuitive way to structure your application with:
- Nested layouts
- Server components by default
- Streaming and suspense
- Built-in loading and error handling

### Server Actions
Server Actions allow you to run server-side code directly from your components:

```typescript
async function createPost(formData: FormData) {
  'use server'
  
  const title = formData.get('title')
  const content = formData.get('content')
  
  // Save to database
  await db.posts.create({
    data: { title, content }
  })
}
```

### Performance Improvements
Next.js 14 includes several performance optimizations:
- Faster bundling with Turbopack
- Improved image optimization
- Better caching strategies
- Reduced JavaScript bundle sizes

## Best Practices

1. **Use Server Components by default** - Only use Client Components when necessary
2. **Implement proper loading states** - Use Suspense boundaries for better UX
3. **Optimize images** - Always use the Next.js Image component
4. **Leverage caching** - Understand and use Next.js caching mechanisms

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 represents a significant step forward in React-based web development. The combination of Server Components, improved performance, and developer experience makes it an excellent choice for modern applications.
